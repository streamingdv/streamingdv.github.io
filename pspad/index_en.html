                               <p>If you use PSPad for the first time you have to register your console with PSPad. The following sections will enlight you about the most important information</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Be sure your smartphone and your console are connected to the same network. Ideally your console is using a wired internet connection via a LAN 
                                cable to provide best performance.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - In order to activate Remote Play on your console you must be logged in with your account on your console.
								<br>
								<br>
								On your console navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>System</i> - <i>Remote Play</i> and activate "Enable Remote Play". Then go to <i>Link Device</i> where you should see the 8 digit
								registration number.
								<br>
								<br>
								On your P-Station 4 navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Remote Play Connection Settings</i> and activate the "Enable Remote Play" checkbox. Then go to <i>Add device</i> where you should see the
								8 digit registration number.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Open PSPad and click the "Register PS" button. On the next screen you can choose if you want to register a console. If you have made your descision
								you can enter the 8 digit registration number on the next screen. If you want to register a console with an older firmware you can choose the firmware of your console in the drop-down list. If
								you do not know what that means just leave the default values. PSPad supports console firmware from 5.05 - 8.03+. If you are ready Click the "Register" button on the bottom of the screen.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 4</strong> - You will now see the official account website. At this point you must sign in to your account which you want to use for Remote Play. 
                                If you do not want to sign in you can also activate the "Register console manually" checkbox in the previous screen. However since the console firmware 7.0 it requires the Account-ID 
                                for the registration process which is unique number linked to your Account. If you do not know it by heart your only option is to continue with the sign in process. If you use an older
                                firmware than 7.0 you can just use your well known Online-ID (Your account user name) during the manual registration process</p>

                                <p><strong>Disclaimer from the developer:</strong> I know providing your account details seems to be shady and I wished there would be another method to get the Account-ID but unfortunately 
                                there is no other easy way. However, PSPad just opens the official Log-In website and there is no technical way that PSPad could in any way intercept, monitor or modify the data you
                                have entered there. PSPad only receives some generic profile information as response from the official server and only the Account-ID and the Online-ID will be stored locally on your device.
                                If really want to avoid using a login <a href="#line8">read this</a>. If you have some additional questions feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 5</strong> - If the registration was successful you will be redirected to the Home screen of PSPad where you can now choose to "Connect" or "Direct Connect" to your console.
                                If you received an error please go to <i>Troubleshooting</i></p>

                                <p>Once you are successfully registered to your console you can choose to "Connect" or to "Direct Connect" to your console on the PSPad Home screen. If you are on the same network than your console
                                simply click "Connect". If you have problems with "Connect" choose "Direct Connect" and provide the IP-Address of your console.</p>
                                
                                <p>If you want to use PSPad as second gamepad in addition to your real Dualshock controller you must have at least a second console guest profile
                                on your console. The real Dualshock controller must then be connected to the console profile which is not currently used by the PSPad Remote Play session, otherwise PSPad will be
                                disconnected. As mentioned before, PSPad is establishing a connection to your console via the Remote Play protocol, despite no Audio and Video stream will be processed by PSPad the console is sending
								these data anyway to your device. So please keep in mind that this will have an impact on your internet traffic.</p>

                        <h4>console Profiles</h4>

                        <p>PSPad can be registered with multiple consoles. A profile is linked to one specific account on one specific console. If you have multiple consoles and/ or multiple accounts, PSPad is able to register more than one profile. If you have already registered a profile just open navigation drawer on the top left corner of the Home screen and click "Register new PS". You can switch to another console profile by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation drawer and click on the "console profile" setting entry on the next screen.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h4>On-Screen gamepad layouts</h4>

                        <p>PSPad offers you the possibility to customize the on-screen gamepad layout. You can create a new gamepad layout by clicking "Gamepad layout" in the navigation drawer. You can switch the layouts by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation drawer and click on the "Gamepad layout" for changing the gamepad layout.</p>

                        <p>You can connect any controller which is compatibly with Android 5.0 an above via Bluetooth or USB. Because of performance problems due hardware limitations on many Android devices it is strongly recommended to use a wired USB connection for your gamepad. Otherwise high input latency and input delays can occur. If you ever encounter some unusual lags please connect your gamepad via USB if possible. Please note that this is not the fault of PSPad, the reason why this happens is because of some hardware limitations of your Android device and that there is no way that PSPad could fix this.</p>
                        <p>If the button mapping of your controller is weird you can create a button mapping profile for your controller by clicking "Button mapping" in the navigation drawer. If one of your gamepad buttons is recognized as Home button you will not be able to use this button as an App can not override this behaviour. However, you can then use the "Use 2 buttons combination" feature in the mapping process instead. If you encounter some unusual button mapping please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a></p>

                                <p>If you are using a controller where the button mapping is messed up or you just want to change the button mapping, you can create a button mapping profile by clicking on "Button mapping" in the navigation drawer. After providing a unique button mapping profile name you can start to map individual buttons of your gamepad. Just be sure your gamepad is properly connected via Bluetooth or via USB. Please be aware that your gamepad might behave differently whether it is connected via Bluetooth or USB, so you may have to create two individual button mapping profiles.</p>
                                <p>On some devices a button on your gamepad may be interpreted as "Home" button, if that is the case you can use the "Use 2 buttons combination" feature to trigger this button by pressing a combination of two other buttons on your gamepad. You can also use this feature if you have too few buttons on your gamepad left. Again: if one of your buttons on your gamepad will be interpreted as "Home" button you will not be able to use it as an application can not override this behaviour.</p>

                        <h4>Problems with PSN login</h4>
						
						<p>More detailed instructions are available <a href="https://streamingdv.github.io/pspad/psn_login.html" target="_blank">here</a>. You should definitely read this if you have login problems</p>
						
						<p>Recently, some users reported problems when performing the login. They will get an error message "A connection to the server could not be established". This seems to be an error on the login website. This login is required since console firmware 7.0 to get your Account-ID which is required for registering with your console. There are some other possibilities to get your Account-ID.</p>

                        <p>You can go to a PC and open the following website and just follow the instructions that appear there. Please note, in the result of the trinket website your actual account id is next to the <i>user_id variable</i> and should look something like this<br><br><i>'user_id': '4474834823397313449'</i><br><br>It consists only of numbers. Click following link and follow the instruction:</p>

						<p>If you are still getting the same error or another error please be sure the credentials you are entering on the login page are correct otherwise you could also try using a free VPN service and pretend you're in a country other than the one you are actually in (also using another Browser might help). Then try to follow the instructions of the website above again.</p>
						
						<p>If that doesn't work either just write me an email at <a href="mailto:f.grill160@gmail.com">f.grill160@gmail.com</a> I will find out your Account-ID which you can then use to register with your console without performing a login. All I need for that is your user name. Please note that I may be living in a different time zone than you, so it may take some time for me to reply to your email.</p>
						
						<p>If you have successfully queried your Account-ID you can register with your console manually without performing a login. In the Register view of PSPad just activate the "Advanced Settings" check "Register console manually"/ "Register console manually" and add the Account-ID in the textbox.</p>

                        <h4>My controller isn't working and mapping feature doesn't register any inputs</h4>
						
						<p>It's very likely that you are suffering from an Android 11 bug introduced by Google. You can find more <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-trouble-getting-games-recognize-their-controllers/amp/" target="_blank">information here</a>. Here is the official Google bug report with a few suggested workarounds <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/163120692?pli=1" target="_blank">https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/163120692?pli=1</a>. You can star the issue to show Google that you are affected. On some devices it helps to disable all or certain accessibility services. It's really an annoying issue and I hope that Google is fixing this bug soon. It's not the fault of PSPad.</p>

                        <h4>Poor connection quality</h4>

                        <p>If possible be sure your Android device is connected to a 5GHz WiFi network instead of a 2.4GHZ. 5GHz networks are usually less prone to interference.</p>

                        <p>Be sure your console is connected to the internet via LAN cable.</p>

                        <p>Some Android devices are affected by a network performance problem. In order to fix this simply place your Android device in flight mode and re-enable WiFi afterwards. Restart the PSPad App and check if it works.</p>

                        <h4>Registration fails</h4>

                        <p>Be sure your smartphone is in the same network than your console.</p>
						
						<p>Be sure that your have enabled Remote Play on your console. (P-Station 5: <i>Settings</i> - <i>System</i> - <i>Remote Play</i> and activate "Enable Remote Play". P-Station 4: <i>Settings</i> - <i>Remote Play Connection Settings</i> and activate the "Enable Remote Play" checkbox)</p>

                        <p>Restart the console and the PSPad App and try again.</p>

                        <h4>Connection fails</h4>

                        <p>Be sure that your smartphone and your console are connected to the same network.</p>

                        <p>Be sure your console is turned on or at least in rest mode. If a console is turned off PSPad can't wake it up.</p>

                        <h4>console does not wake from rest mode</h4>

                        <p>Please be sure that your console stays connected to the internet during rest mode. On the console navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>System</i> - <i>Power Saving</i> - <i>Click Features Available in Rest mode</i> and check if both the "Stay Connected to the internet" and "Enable Turning On from Network" are activated. On your console navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Power Saving Settings</i> - <i>Set Features Available in Rest mode</i> and check if both the "Stay Connected to the internet" and "Enable Turning On from Network" are activated.</p>

						<h4>PSPad does not work correctly on my Chome OS device</h4>
						
						<p>Chrome OS offers Android app support, however some functionalities are limited and will not work. First of all, automatically discover your console will not work as the firewall on Chrome OS devices is blocking the discovery request. In order to register with your console or to simply connect, you have to enter the IP-Address of your console manually. PSPad was not designed especially for Chrome OS devices but only for Android and Android TV devices. I do not want to prevent installations on Chrome OS devices because on some Chrome OS devices PSPad might work quite well, but please keep in mind that there could be some potential limitations when you are using PSPad on Chrome OS.</p>
