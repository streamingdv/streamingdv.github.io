                                <p>If you use XBXPad for the first time you have to register your XBox with XBXPad. The following sections will enlighten you about the most important information</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Be sure your XBox console is turned on and that Remote Play is enabled on your console You can check if Remote Play is enabled on your XBox by navigating to Settings -> Devices & connections -> Remote features.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Open XBXPad and click the "Register XBox" button afterwards click the "Register" button on the bottom of the screen.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 4</strong> - You will now see the official XBox Live account website. At this point you must sign in to your XBox account which you want to use for Remote Play.</p>

                                <p><strong>Disclaimer from the developer:</strong> I know providing your account details seems to be shady and I wished there would be another method to use Remote Play but unfortunately 
                                there is no other way and remote play only works with XBox live credentials. However, XBXPad just opens the official XBox Live Log-In website from Microsoft and there is no technical way that XBXPad could in any way intercept, monitor or modify the data you
                                have entered there. XBXPad only receives some generic profile information as response from the official Microsoft server and only the credential tokens will be stored locally encrypted on your device.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 5</strong> - If the registration was successful you will be redirected to the Home screen of XBXPad where you can now choose to "Connect" to your XBox.
                                If you received an error please go to <i>Troubleshooting</i></p>

                        <h4>XBox Profiles</h4>

                        <p>Unlike the official XBox Remote Play app, XBXPad can be registered with multiple XBox profiles. A profile is linked to one specific XBox Live account. If you have multiple XBox consoles and/ or multiple XBox Live accounts, XBXPad is able to register more than one profile. If you have already registered a profile just open navigation drawer on the top left corner of the Home screen and click "Register new XBox". You can switch to another XBox profile by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation drawer and click on the "XBox profile" setting entry on the next screen.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h4>On-Screen gamepad layouts</h4>

                        <p>XBXPad offers you the possibility to customize the on-screen gamepad layout. You can either create a new remote layout by clicking "Remote layout" or you can create a new gamepad layout by clicking "Gamepad layout" in the navigation drawer. You can switch the layouts by clicking "Profiles" in the navigation drawer and click on the "Gamepad layout" entry for changing the gamepad layout.</p>

                        <p>On Android you can connect any controller which is compatibly with Android 5.0 an above via Bluetooth or USB. Because of performance problems due hardware limitations on many Android devices it is strongly recommended to use a wired USB connection for your gamepad on Android. Otherwise high input latency and input delays can occur. If you ever encounter some unusual lags please connect your gamepad via USB if possible. Please note that this is not the fault of XBXPad, the reason why this happens is because of some hardware limitations of your Android device and that there is no way that XBXPad could fix this.</p>
                        <p>If the button mapping of your controller is weird you can create a button mapping profile for your controller by clicking "Button mapping" in the navigation drawer. If one of your gamepad buttons is recognized as Home button you will not be able to use this button as an app can not override this behavior. However, you can then use the "Use 2 buttons combination" feature in the mapping process instead.</p>

                                <p>If you are using a controller where the button mapping is messed up or you just want to change the button mapping, you can create a button mapping profile by clicking on "Button mapping" in the navigation drawer. After providing a unique button mapping profile name you can start to map individual buttons of your gamepad. Just be sure your gamepad is properly connected via Bluetooth or via USB. Please be aware that your gamepad might behave differently whether it is connected via Bluetooth or USB, so you may have to create two individual button mapping profiles.</p>
                                <p>On some devices a button on your gamepad may be interpreted as "Home" button, if that is the case you can use the "Use 2 buttons combination" feature to trigger this button by pressing a combination of two other buttons on your gamepad. You can also use this feature if you have too few buttons on your gamepad left. Again: if one of your buttons on your gamepad will be interpreted as "Home" button you will not be able to use it as an application can not override this behavior.</p>

                        <h4>My controller isn't working on my Android device and the mapping feature doesn't register any inputs</h4>
						
						<p>It's very likely that you are suffering from an Android 11 bug introduced by Google. You can find more <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-trouble-getting-games-recognize-their-controllers/amp/" target="_blank">information here</a>. Here is the official Google bug report with a few suggested workarounds <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/163120692?pli=1" target="_blank">https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/163120692?pli=1</a>. On some devices, it helps to disable all accessibility services and restart the device. It's really an annoying issue which is already fixed in Android 12. It's not the fault of XBXPad.</p>

                        <h4>Poor connection quality</h4>

                        <p>If possible be sure your device is connected to a 5GHz WiFi network instead of a 2.4GHZ. 5GHz networks are usually less prone to interference.</p>

                        <p>Be sure your XBox is connected to the internet via LAN cable.</p>

                        <p>Some Android devices are affected by a network performance problem. In order to fix this simply place your Android device in flight mode and re-enable WiFi afterwards. Restart the XBXPad app and check if it works. Furthermore, an active Bluetooth connection can also interfere the network stability on some devices. Please check if the connection is more stable when you deactivate Bluetooth completely.</p>

                        <h4>Registration fails</h4>

                        <p>Be sure that your have enabled Remote Play on your XBox. (XBox: <i>Settings</i> - <i>Device & connection</i> - <i>Remote features</i> and activate "Enable Remote features")</p>

                        <p>Restart the XBox and the XBXPad app and try again. Also, make sure that the device you're using XBXPad on doesn't have a VPN connection or an ad-blocking app activated, otherwise the connection to your XBox could be blocked.</p>

                        <h4>Connection fails</h4>

                        <p>Be sure that your smartphone and your XBox are connected to the same network.</p>

                        <p>If your XBox don't want to go in ready for connect state please hard restart your console (Turn off your console, wait until it is fully turned off, unplug the power cord from your console and wait again ~30 seconds and restart it).</p>
						
                        <p>Be sure your XBox is turned on or at least in rest mode. If a XBox is turned off XBXPad can't wake it up. You must set the power options of your console to 'Sleep' in order to allow apps like XBXPad to wake up your console.  Also, make sure that the device you're using XBXPad on doesn't have a VPN connection or an ad-blocking app activated, otherwise the connection to your XBox could be blocked.</p>

                        <h4>XBox does not wake from rest mode</h4>

                        <p>Please be sure that your XBox stays connected to the internet during rest mode. On the console navigate to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Device & connections</i> - <i>Remote features</i> - <i>Power options</i> - <i>Choose 'Sleep'</i></p>

                        <h4>Crackling and&#47; or delayed sound when using a controller</h4>
						
						<p>If you have this problem, please stop XBXPad and reconnect your controller to your device. Open the XBXPad again and connect to the XBox, the problem should be gone. On some devices, connecting a controller while streaming could lead to delays and other problems. In order to avoid this please always connect your controller before you start streaming.</p>

                        <h4>No sound when using a wired Dualsense/ Dualshock controller</h4>

                        <p>Despite huge efforts to make the audio work on all Android devices when a wired Dualshock/ Dualsense controller is connected some devices still try to route the audio to the controller which will result in no audio at all while streaming. However, if you have this problem there is a workaround. Just disable "automatic USB audio routing" in the developer options of your device. The developer options are hidden by default, follow the instructions below to disable USB audio routing:</p>
                                    
                        <ol>
						    <li>Open the Settings app on your Android device</li>
                            <li>(Only on Android 8.0 or higher) Select System.</li>
                            <li>Scroll to the bottom and select About phone.</li>
                            <li>Scroll to the bottom and tap Build number 7 times.</li>
                            <li>Return to the previous screen to find Developer options near the bottom.</li>
							<li>Disable "USB audio routing" in the developer options</li>
							<li>You may have to restart the XBXPad app and remove and reconnect the Dualshock controller</li>
                        </ol>
